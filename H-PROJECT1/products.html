            <b>Fire Alarm System &#x1F534; : </b>Automatic fire alarm systems
            are activated through fire detectors, such as smoke or heat sensors.
            Manual fire alarms are activated with manual call points or pull
            stations. There is no reason for a fire alarm system to exclude one
            or the other. Both can be included in the same system. Conventional
            fire alarms work as one unit and cannot pinpoint the exact area of
            activation unless inspected. Addressable fire alarms have a
            specially dedicated address for each fire alarm detector that is
            connected to the control panel, for easier identification of the
            source of the danger.
